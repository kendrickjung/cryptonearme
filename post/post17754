{"name":"Benny's Boardroom","description":"We started Benny’s Boardroom to scratch our itch for good stuff. And our definition of good is pretty rigorous. Good means really, really good.\n\nEverything here shares a quality: it's good in every way that matters. Good for you, the planet and the people who make them. Oh, and mighty good to use and look at.\n\nThing is, good can be hard to find. Especially when you refuse to compromise on values like quality, function, aesthetics and ethics. Luckily, many of you feel the same way. Turns out, good business is good business.\n\nWe’re customers at heart too. We love feeling the thrill, fascination and desire for great and useful things.\n\nAnd we know you want to make good choices too. So we’ve made it much easier: everything on our site is good in every way. Box ticked. Job done.\n\nNow let’s shop.","links":["https://bennysboardroom.com.au/","https://www.facebook.com/BennysBoardroom/","https://www.twitter.com/bennysboardroom"],"keywords":[],"street":"Online Only","city":"MANLY","state":"NSW","phone":null,"email":"partners@bennysboardroom.com.au","fax":null,"lat":-33.80254409475938,"lon":151.29083633422852}
