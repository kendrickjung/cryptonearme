{"name":"Ferndale Cat Cafe","description":"The first permanent cat cafe in Michigan, the Catfe Lounge is a different take on the cat cafe concept. We don’t just partner with a animal rescue, we are a part of the Ferndale Cat Shelter – a 501c3 cat rescue.\n\nWe accept Bitcoin for cat adoptions, donations, coffee, ect. We're also a safe place for a local trade. \n\nPatrons can visit the Catfe Lounge on a donation basis (tax deductible) and play with the cats and kittens or just watch them napping (which can be very therapeutic!)\nHelp yourself to premium coffee, tea, and a variety of treats.\n\nWe also have free wifi so you will be able to post and share all of the kitty pics and videos for your friends and family.\n\nFor liability reasons, we ask that you please leave your own animals at home.","links":["http://catfe.cafe/","https://www.facebook.com/catfelounge/"],"keywords":[],"street":"Livernois Street","city":"Ferndale","state":"Michigan","phone":"(248) 733-3554","email":null,"fax":null,"lat":42.453449557115604,"lon":-83.14285755157469}
