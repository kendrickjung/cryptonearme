{"name":"Yardbird Southern Fried Chicken","description":"Yardbird is Zurich's very first Southern Fried Chicken restaurant. It is the brainchild of the same people behind The Bite Gourmet Burger Restaurant and Brisket Southern BBQ & Bar.\n\nThe name \"Yardbird\" comes from a term derived in the deep South, where chickens are often considered the bird that runs freely in your backyard. It's a staple in the South and will now be introduced to Zurich.\n\nAll meat is locally sourced Swiss chicken and is served double-fried, buttermilk-style with three on-the-bone pieces per portion. Our chicken is brined for 24-hours and tossed in house spices. Each menu creation is inspired by traditional, local delicacies from the South, which we've put together using a modern twist. We hope you enjoy what we do!","links":["http://www.yardbird.ch","https://www.facebook.com/yardbird.ch"],"keywords":[],"street":"Weststrasse ","city":"Zürich","state":"Zürich","phone":"+41 44 342 30 00","email":"info@yardbird.ch","fax":null,"lat":47.373393596648306,"lon":8.518964052200317}
