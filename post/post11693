{"name":"Moon On The Water","description":"Friendly Vegan Restaurant/Cafe and venue for music and the arts.\n\nMoon on the Water is a Social Enterprise managed by TLC Feels Good LTD and is largely run by volunteers. We are a “not for profit” organisation that has received some National Lottery funding to get started and is working in partnership with the Big Local to reach its goals.\n\nWe are an arts and entertainment venue that has well-being at the heart of its ethos - that of the regional music and arts scene, the local people and visitors, the environment, the climate, Earth’s sustainability and the non-human creatures we share this beautiful planet with. The aim is to provide a multifunctional, comfortable, state of the art equipped 400 capacity medium sized music and arts venue and community space for people of all ages. We have a fully licensed dog friendly vegan bar and café with spectacular views of the Humber estuary and aim to provide the tastiest and most nutritious vegan food possible in a safe and comfortable environment and offer a new and exciting venue for local people and visitors to come and enjoy local activities.\n\nWe regularly host Yoga, Pilates,Tai Chi and Swing/Jive dance classes as well as our weekly Special Needs Disco, Acoustic Saturdays and Jazz Sunday events and our aim is to provide arts and live music events covering as full a range of genres as possible.","links":["http://www.moononthewater.org.uk","https://www.facebook.com/lovemoonwater"],"keywords":[],"street":"North Promenade","city":"Cleethorpes","state":"North East Lincolnshire","phone":"01472 601528","email":"info@moononthewater.org.uk","fax":null,"lat":53.56454400134563,"lon":-0.031424760818481445}
