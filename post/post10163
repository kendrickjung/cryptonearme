{"name":"La Cascade du Chocolat","description":"La Cascade du Chocolat is a New Hampshire based craft chocolate shop. Using over a dozen carefully selected fine chocolates from around the world, we produce small batches of unique truffles, bars, and chocolate confections. Each piece is hand-crafted from start to finish. Our Chocolatiers hand temper, roll, enrobe, dip, mold and package each batch. \n\nAt La Cascade du Chocolat, we believe in using local, organic ingredients where possible and we combine them in thoughtful and innovative ways to create a one of a kind tasting experience.\n","links":["https://www.lacascadeduchocolat.com"],"keywords":[],"street":"Water Street","city":"Exeter","state":"New Hampshire","phone":null,"email":null,"fax":null,"lat":42.98170119723615,"lon":-70.94717502593994}
