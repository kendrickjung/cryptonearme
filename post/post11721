{"name":"Mi Casa Es Tu Casa","description":"Mi Casa Es Tu Casa created an original music and movement class carefully designed to introduce and reinforce Spanish for little children and their caregivers through a variety of rich rhythms, fun props, silly games and many other surprises. Where all the senses are stimulated to offer the best and most thorough experience for language acquisition besides all benefits that music classes offer. This class is MamaCanta... or like a dad called it recently... #PapaCanta! All parents, grandparents and other caregivers are more than welcome to come!","links":["https://www.micasastucasa.com/","https://www.facebook.com/micasastucasa/"],"keywords":[],"street":"Robert Browning Street","city":"Austin","state":"Texas","phone":"512-945-4737 ","email":"laura@micasastucasa.com","fax":null,"lat":30.2987408812878,"lon":-97.701963186264}
