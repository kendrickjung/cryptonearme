{"name":"Retrome Urban Retreat","description":"When you love Barcelona, you’ll love Retrome. Retrome is your urban retreat that loves the cities it is in. It searches for the good things in life to do within that city: where to eat, where to go, what to do. Retrome discovers the city again and again and shares this with you, so your visit to the city becomes an experience you’ll love while staying in a place that feels safe and warm; a true urban retreat.\nRetrome uses vintage handpicked mid-century design for its furniture.","links":["https://www.retrome.net/","https://www.facebook.com/RetromeUrbanRetreat/"],"keywords":[],"street":"Carrer de Girona ","city":"Barcelona","state":"Barcelona","phone":"931 74 40 37","email":"info@retrome.net","fax":null,"lat":41.395266177886924,"lon":2.170271873474121}
