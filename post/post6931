{"name":"Good Dream Guesthouse","description":"Located in Krabitown, Good Dream is one of the town's longest-running guesthouses:  We offer rooms to suit nearly any budget and were the first places to offer something you don't find often in Thailand - honesty!  I started Good Dream by accident, but then turned it into a place where travelers can feel safe around every turn.  There are no tricks here, no high-pressure sales, no lies about tours and onward travel.  A place to feel secure that we are telling you the truth.  I believe we accomplish this goal, every day.    \n\nOk, about us.  We are one of the more popular guesthouses in Krabi for a very good reason.  Our prices are cheap, we are helpful people, and we tell you the truth!  Amazing!  Right?  wow!  honesty!  Our rooms are very affordable and we have a little something for everyone.  We have been featured in nearly every guidebook including Lonely Planet, Rough Guide, and Footprints (although i am yet to encounter a single traveler that uses the latter.)  We have received the TripAdvisor Certificate of excellence for 2012,  2013, and 2014 as well.   We try to cater to everyone, but for the most part we focus on helping out budget travelers so they get more for their money.
