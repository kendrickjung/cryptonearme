{"name":"Takeme","description":"Takeme is a solution to the transport industry in New Zealand. \n\nWe believe that customers should have an option when requesting a private hire service based on what they can afford, currently in NZ that doesn't exist, due to the fact that big corporations take big part of the market shares in the transport industry, and we want and we will change that. We'd like to offer a huge opportunity that allows you to become interdependently free from the massive transport corporations and monopoly business through New Zealand, allowing our customers to choose from 3 options of vehicle, such as budget, standard and luxury.","links":["http://www.takeme.nz","https://www.facebook.com/takemenewzealand"],"keywords":[],"street":"Camp Street","city":"Queenstown","state":"Otago","phone":"0800 825 363","email":"contact@takeme.nz","fax":null,"lat":-45.03047637608126,"lon":168.6601459980011}
